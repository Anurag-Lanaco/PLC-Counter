PLC counter using Photoelectric sensors

Anurag here. I'm here to learn how to code and be an expert someday in the near future.
My first project is a PLC counter using photoelectric sensors. For this project, I'll be using the following hardware below.
1) Banner sensor QS18VP6FF100Q8
2) Digital display Counter from Red lion #PAX2D
3) Click PLC C0-00DR-D
